# Data Pipeline Project: ETL

## Project Overview:
For the ETL mini project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
